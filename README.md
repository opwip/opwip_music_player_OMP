# opwip_music_player OMP

I am tired of using sporify

# Supported features(unique)ðŸ˜Š

Fully supports importing songs from osu! (Legacy version) \Songs directory (I TRIED MY BEST BC PEOPLE NAME MAIN AUDIO RANDOMLY :( and I dont want to just name it with folder name bc it will disable Artist Title properties for all other songs))

P.S.
I will delete this paragraph in readme when problem will be resolved, BUT FOR NOW when u launch the app please add song 1 song of your choice first. lalala is a placeholder because I`m too lame

# Troubleshooting
If you`ve changed the directory where OMP.exe sits you should also search for music.json and change it's directory to the new one so you won't lose your music.
